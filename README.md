# Polar Wings
Created in collaboration with Roy Rosen

This is an experiment with particles simulation and polar coordinates, what happens when you use convert only the "U" and "radius" dimensions to polar and feed it to the position attribute?

Obviously, it doesn't make sense, but it is very interesting to watch
